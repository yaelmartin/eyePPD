# eyePPD

## **Introduction**

eyePPD is a tool designed to quickly measure the maximum Pixels Per Degree (PPD) that your eyes can perceive in ideal conditions.

## Why PPD matters

Working with VR display specifications isn't as easy as monitors and TV.

Knowing the PPI (pixels per inch) of a HMD isn't enough to know how it will it look in VR. A high PPI display could be spread across a large field of view.

Also, headsets often have optics that fit more pixels in the center than the edges, prioritizing the most looked-at area.

A great unit to measure the potential maximum clarity of a headset is its center PPD (pixels per degree).

It makes it easy to compare potential clarity between HMDs of different field of view, different PPI, different pixel amount.

PPD is slowly increasing with each generation of XR devices, and once we reach the acuity of the human eye, it will be pointless to increase it.

With a quick internet search, you may stumble upon this value: 60PPD.\
However this is actually far from the maximum the eye can perceive. Use this project to see for your own acuity!

## Prerequisites

- Use a screen that is both high resolution and small. Smartphones are great.
- Make sure your screen is clean; something might be bigger than the test area or hide it.
- A way to interact with the device, such as a wireless keyboard with a numpad
- A way to measure the width of your screen and viewing distance

## How to use the tool:

- Open the [tool's page](https://yaelmartin.github.io/eyePPD/)
- Measure your screen width in cm
- Measure your viewing distance (>3 meters allows for more accurate results)
- Click the "Init Fullscreen" button and fill the fields
- With your numpad 1-9 keys, select the square which contains the black square

Note: I used centimeters, but any unit will work for the width/viewing distance as long as they are the same.
