# eyePPD

## **Introduction**

Working with VR displays specifications isn't as easy as monitors and TV.

Knowing the PPI (pixels per inch) of a HMD isn't enough to know how will it look in VR. A high PPI display could be spread accross a large field of view.

Also headsets often have optics that fit more pixels in the center than the edges, prioritizing the most looked area.

A great unit to measure the potential max clarity of a heaset is its center PPD (pixels per degree).

PPD makes it easy to compair clarity between HMDs of different field of view, different PPI, different pixels amount.

PPD is slowly increasing with each generation of XR devices, but once we reach the acuity of the human eye, it will be pointless to increase it.

With a quick internet search, you may stumble appon this value: 60PPD.

eyePPD is a tool that make it easy to the max PPD your eyes are able to see.

## Prerequisites

- Use a screen that is both high resolution and small. >2.5k screen laptops are great. <br> (Later, UI might get modified to work on phones and achieve even more precise results)

- Make sure scalling is at 100% in your OS and with your browser. (Check with https://whatismyviewport.com/)

- Make sure your screen is clean, something might be bigger than the test area or hide it.

## How to use the tool:

- Open the tool's page in fullscreen
- Measure in cm your screen width
- Measure your viewing distance (>3 meters allows for more accurate results)
- With a wireless keyboard, select the square which contains the black square with your numpad 1-9 keys
